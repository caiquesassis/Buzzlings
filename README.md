# Buzzlings 🐝
A web-based simulation where you manage a dynamic colony of creatures called Buzzlings, balancing their needs and behaviors through creation and maintenance via CRUD operations.

LIVE DEMO: coming soon...

In this simulation, you create and manage a colony of creatures, each with distinct roles. By using CRUD operations, you ensure the hive stays balanced and functional, addressing challenges like internal conflict and resource management.

This project uses:
- Entity Framework Core to handle database operations
- Identity for Authentication
- [?] for Tests
